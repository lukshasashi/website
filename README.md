## Features

This repository includes several features to enhance your web application:

- **Responsive Design**: The website adapts to various screen sizes, ensuring a great user experience on all devices.

## Usage

After setting up the project, you can start customizing it to fit your needs. Here are some common tasks:

### Adding New Pages

To add a new page, create a new file in the `src/pages` directory. For example, to create an `about` page:

1. Create a file named `about.js` in `src/pages`.
2. Add the following code:

   ```javascript
   import React from 'react';

   const About = () => {
       return (
           <div>
               <h1>About Us</h1>
               <p>This is the about page.</p>
           </div>
       );
   };

   export default About;
   ```

3. Update the routing in your main application file to include the new page.

### Customizing Styles

Styles are located in the `src/styles` directory. You can modify existing styles or add new CSS files as needed. For example, to change the background color:

1. Open `src/styles/main.css`.
2. Add or modify the following rule:

   ```css
   body {
       background-color: #f0f0f0;
   }
   ```

### Deploying the Website

To deploy your website, you can use services like Vercel, Netlify, or GitHub Pages. Each platform has its own setup instructions. Here’s a quick overview for deploying to GitHub Pages:

1. Build the project:

   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

2. Navigate to the build directory:

   ```bash
   cd build
   ```

3. Initialize a new Git repository:

   ```bash
   git init
   ```

4. Add your files and commit:

   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Deploying to GitHub Pages"
   ```

5. Push to the `gh-pages` branch:

   ```bash
   git push -f origin master:gh-pages
   ```

Your website should now be live at `https://your-username.github.io/website`.
